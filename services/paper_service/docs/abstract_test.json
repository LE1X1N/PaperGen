  "abstract_en": "With the development of educational informatization, school-family interaction platforms have become important tools for improving educational quality. This study designs and implements a school-family interaction platform based on Android mobile terminal, XAMPP integrated environment, and MySQL database. The platform adopts B/S architecture, realizing real-time information exchange between families and schools through Android client, utilizing XAMPP to build web service environment, and storing user information, teaching resources, and interaction data with MySQL database. The system functions include student information management, homework publishing and submission, grade inquiry, notification announcements, and online communication modules. Through system testing verification, the platform demonstrates good stability, security, and user experience, effectively addressing issues of low efficiency and delayed information transmission in traditional school-family communication, providing technical support for building modern school-family collaborative education systems.",
