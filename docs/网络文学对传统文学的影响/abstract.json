  "abstract_en": "This study explores the multidimensional impacts of online literature on traditional literature. Through literature analysis and case study methods, this paper examines the influence of online literature on traditional literature from four dimensions: creative modes, dissemination methods, reader reception, and literary values. The research finds that online literature, with its interactive, real-time, and popular characteristics, has transformed the creative ecosystem of traditional literature and promoted innovation and development in literary forms. Meanwhile, online literature and traditional literature exhibit mutual reference and integrated development in content creation and expressive techniques. This influence is reflected not only in the commercial transformation of the literary industry but also in the diversification of literary criticism standards. The research conclusions provide theoretical support for understanding the development patterns of literature in the digital age.",
