  "abstract_en": "This study focuses on the financing challenges and breakthrough pathways of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Through literature analysis and empirical research methods, this paper thoroughly investigates the main problems faced by SMEs in the financing process. The research finds that information asymmetry, insufficient collateral, high financing costs, and unsatisfactory bank-enterprise relationships are the core bottlenecks constraining SME development. Based on this, the paper proposes systematic breakthrough paths from four dimensions: policy support, financial innovation, credit system construction, and enterprise capability enhancement. The findings indicate that building a diversified financing system, improving risk-sharing mechanisms, and optimizing financial service models are effective approaches to solving SME financing difficulties, providing theoretical support and practical guidance for policy formulation and operational implementation.",
